# Horiseon-Refactor
A refactor project for Horiseon Solutions

## Description
This is a project for Horiseon Solution Services's main webpage. I was tasked with refactoring their HTML code to have it meet accessibility standards and be optimized for search engines. This includes adding semantic elements, improving code structure, adding alt attributes to icons and image elements, and adding a discriptive title. 

## Installation
To view the source code, you can either view the **index.html** and **./assets/css/stlyes.css** files on GitHub, or clone the respository to your machine and open with a code editor.

## Usage
Once you have access to the source code, you can view the refactor changes that have been made by reading the comments. If you open the **index.html** file in a browser, it should look like this:
